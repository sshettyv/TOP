How to ask questions ? 
1. always provide your code and the surrounding context . 
2. ask about the problem at hand , not the solution itself . 
3. provide more context , if they ask for it .

4. XY problem , explain the problem X , instead of asking solution for Y which you think is the solution for X . 
5. helping you is not the highest point of the other user.
