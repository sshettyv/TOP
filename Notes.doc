How to ask questions ? 
1. always provide your code and the surrounding context . 
2. ask about the problem at hand , not the solution itself . 
3. provide more context , if they ask for it . 
https://medium.com/@gordon_zhu/how-to-be-great-at-asking-questions-e37be04d0603
4. XY problem , explain the problem X , instead of asking solution for Y which you think is the solution for X . 
5. helping you is not the highest point of the other user. 

How to google . 
1.Use tools option to limit search period/ specific words only. 
2. use " " to search for specific phrase included with something.  
3. use - to exclude search with particular words . 


Dont ask to ask , just ask . dont start the question with " any java experts around? " 
While asking include : 
what you think is the problem , what exactly do you want to happen 
what is actually happening , how did you get there , what have you tried so far / 
provide screenshot eg: command line , error message , console etc
